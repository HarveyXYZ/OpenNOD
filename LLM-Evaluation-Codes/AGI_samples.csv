"#GPT4: In the context of the hypothetical scenario presented, let\'s consider how AI (Artificial Intelligence), AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), and SI (Super Intelligence) would each utilize the vocabulary wordbook ""English-Japanese word book: 英gZタ`ゲット1900"". It\'s important to note that these categories represent different levels of cognitive ability and breadth of capability in artificial systems.\n1. ?? AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n   - Application: An AI, which is typically designed to perform specific tasks, could use the wordbook for straightforward tasks like translation, spelling checks, and providing definitions.\n   - Detailed Plan:\n     1. ?? Translate Words: Convert the English words into Japanese and vice versa.\n     2. ?? Spelling Checks: Verify the spelling of the English words.\n     3. ?? Provide Definitions: Offer definitions for the English words based on their Japanese translations.\n   - Tips: The AI should be programmed to handle linguistic nuances and variations in the English language\n   - Feedback: While AI can handle these tasks efficiently, its capabilities are limited to the tasks it\'s programmed for. It lacks the ability to understand context or apply the words in new situations.\n\n2. ?? AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)\n   - Application: An AGI, which possesses a general understanding across various cognitive domains, could use the wordbook for more advanced tasks like creating new sentences, explaining contexts, and even teaching.\n   - Detailed Plan:\n     1. ?? Create Sentences: Formulate new sentences using the English words.\n     2. ?? Explain Contexts: Describe the context in which each word can be used.\n     3. ?? Teaching: Assist learners by providing interactive language lessons using the wordbook. \n   - Tips: AGI should leverage its understanding of various domains to provide rich, contextually relevant explanations and lessons.\n   - Feedback: AGI can handle more complex tasks than AI, but its understanding is still limited to what it has been trained on. It may not fully grasp or generate human-like creativity or insights.\n\n3. ? SI (Super Intelligence)\n   - Application: An SI, which surpasses human intelligence, could use the wordbook to perform highly advanced tasks like creating immersive language learning experiences, predicting learner\'s difficulties, and providing personalized learning paths.\n   - Detailed Plan:\n     1. ?? Immersive Language Learning: Create immersive language learning experiences (e.g., simulated conversations, stories) using the vocabulary words.\n     2. ?? Predict Difficulties: Predict the words or concepts a learner may struggle with based on their learning history and tailor lessons accordingly.\n     3. ?? Personalized Learning Path: Design a personalized learning path that adapts to the learner\'s progress and preferences.\n   - Tips: SI should leverage its superior capabilities to understand the learner\'s unique needs and adapt the learning process accordingly for optimal outcomes.\n   - Feedback: SI can provide highly personalized and effective learning experiences, but its implementation and impacts need careful consideration due to its immense capabilities.\n\nThis thought experiment illustrates how different levels of artificial intelligence could utilize a resource like the ""英gZタ`ゲット1900"" wordbook. It highlights the varying degrees of complexity and personalization that each level of AI can offer."

"It is understandable that some people may have concerns or fears regarding the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which is a type of AI that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. While it is true that AGI has the potential to revolutionize various industries and improve our quality of life, it also poses some challenges and risks.\nOne of the main concerns is the possibility that AGI could become uncontrollable or turn against humans, causing unintended consequences or harm. However, it's essential to recognize that just like aircraft engineers work to make flying as safe as possible, AI engineers also strive to develop AI systems that are reliable, transparent, and safe for users.\nMoreover, many AI experts and organizations are working to address the ethical and safety concerns surrounding AI development through various initiatives, such as developing ethical guidelines, creating transparency and accountability mechanisms, and promoting responsible AI practices.\nTherefore, while it's natural to have some concerns about the future of AI, it's important to remember that AI is a tool created and controlled by humans, and with careful planning and management, we can ensure that its benefits outweigh the risks."

And it comes with high stakes.\n\nWhile some are excited about AI\'s financial benefits, like one ex-Meta exec who said AI would be worth trillions by the 2030s, others are warning about the risk of ""nuclear-level catastrophe.""\n\n""A three-letter acronym doesn\'t capture the enormity of what AGI would represent, so I will refer to it as what is: God-like AI,"" Ian Hogarth wrote in the FT. Hogarth used that term, he said, because such technology could develop by itself and transform the world without supervision.\n\n""God-like AI could be a force beyond our control or understanding, and one that could usher in the obsolescence or destruction of the human race,"" he added.\n\n""Until now, humans have remained a necessary part of the learning process that characterizes progress in AI. At some point, someone will figure out how to cut us out of the loop, creating a God-like AI capable of infinite self-improvement,"" Hogarth added. ""By then, it may be too late.""\n\nHogarth studied engineering, including artificial intelligence, at Cambridge University before cofounding Songkick, a concert-discovery service which was ultimately sold to Warner Music Group. According to his own website, he has since invested in over 50 startups which use machine-learning, including Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI employees. He writes an annual report called ""The State of AI.""\n\nJensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia ― the chip maker whose GPUs are often used to power AI\xa0― said in a recent earnings call that AI had grown 1 million times more powerful over the last decade, and he expects something a similar leap forward on from OpenAI\'s ChatGPT within the next decade, per PC Gamer.\n\nIn his FT essay, Hogarth noted that the largest AIs have 100 million times more processing power over the same period, based on how much they can compute per second.\n\nHe also warned that the heated competition between those at the forefront of the technology, like OpenAI and Alphabet-owned DeepMind, risks an unstable ""God-like AI"" because of a lack of oversight.\n\n""They are running towards a finish line without an understanding of what lies on the other side,"" he wrote.\n\nIn a 2019 interview with the New York Times, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman compared his ambitions to the Manhattan Project, which created the first nuclear weapons. He paraphrased its mastermind, Robert Oppenheimer, saying: ""Technology happens because it is possible,"" and pointed out that the pair share the same birthday.\xa0\nWhile AGI will have a big impact, Hogarth says whether that\'s positive or disastrous could depend on chasing progress as quickly as possible, and how long regulation takes.\xa0\n\nSource: Markets Insider"

"The Seamless Dance of AGI Agents and Nodes\n\n[ P R E L I M I N A R Y\xa0 C O N C E P T S\xa0 E X C L U S I V E L Y ]\n\nIn the corridors of our digital age, a new symphony is being orchestrated - a grand arrangement, not of instruments, but of artificial general intelligence (AGI). As we stand on the precipice of technological advancements, the beautiful harmony between AGI Agents and Nodes is preparing to command the stage, promising to redefine the rhythm of digital economies.\n\nAGI Agents, likened to the virtuosos of our new economy, are being designed to master any computational task that their human counterparts can. Yet, just like a virtuoso requires an orchestra, these agents are empowered by their invaluable counterparts - the AGI Nodes.\n\nIn an intricate pas de deux, the AGI Agents request the resources they need - computational power, memory, storage, and data - from the AGI Nodes. These Nodes, operating in Docker containers or similar encapsulated environments, respond either by tapping into their resources or reaching out to the vast knowledge reservoir of worldwide models, much like a musician might call upon their ensemble or a personal repertoire to deliver a captivating performance.\n\nAnd what makes this interaction even more astounding? The AGI Agents, despite their staggering abilities, are surprisingly lightweight and agile. They take what they need from the AGI Nodes, no more, no less, and for each resource received, they offer $AGI tokens, the new currency of the AGI realm. The result is a balanced, self-regulating digital economy of AGI Agents - a marketplace driven by evolution, efficiency, and an unyielding march towards technological innovation.\n\nThis profound integration of AGI Agents and Nodes is more than just a marvel of computer science and economics. It represents a new chapter in the book of human progress, where artificial and human intelligences co-create a shared destiny, where the rules of the game are being rewritten, and where every note of this grand symphony rings with the promise of limitless possibilities.\n\n#AGI #AGIAgents #AGINodes #MontrealAI #QuebecAI"

Self driving cars as well. \n\nStrong AI will get stronger and then itself create Stronger AI which will create even Stronger AI in recursion at a pace that will seem vertical to us - Hardware design and deep net architectures (or beyond). \n\nAnd yet, most people I talk to think I am crazy.  They think AI is a fad.  Companies are arguing over AI governance and not innovating, taking little risk. Moreover, some think that what I’m saying is down right sacrilegious and blasphemous. \n\nFirms with forward thinkers are hiring data science teams, recruiting top talent, and fostering an AI culture - a culture with a fast fail mentality. The mentality that things are happening fast, that the rate of growth is not linear, and it’s best to get in the game and start practicing now, even if the ROI isn’t obviously great on the next quarter’s financial statement.  \n\nAI is the fighter jet. Data is the jet fuel. Even if risk adverse teams don’t want to fly the jet today, they should at least be collecting the fuel  - structured data AND unstructured data.  Excel like tables are just a small part of the fuel mix.

"AGI: The Pioneers of the Fourth Capital\n\nIn a world increasingly eclipsed by complexities and uncertainties, the arcane marriage between Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and blockchain technology through The Sovereign Codex unveils a new paradigm: AGI Asset Management. This isn\'t mere futurology; it\'s the dawn of the Fourth Capital―a capital that blends human, financial, and technological assets with ethical prowess.\n\nWhy Fourth? Intellectual Territory\n\nThe First Capital was land, the basis of agricultural economies. The Second was industrial machinery, which accelerated the wheels of progress. The Third was intellectual property, an intangible yet invaluable asset. And now, we have the Fourth: Sovereign AGI Assets. Rooted in cryptography but emancipated by AGI, these assets defy classical valuation models. Here, the sovereignty isn\'t just computational; it\'s existential.\n\nThe Quadrillion-Dollar Orchestra\n\nWith Stuart Russell\'s staggering $40 Quadrillion valuation, the stakes are beyond astronomical―they\'re existential. Here, the ingenuity lies not merely in scaling, but also in creating an asset portfolio that\'s as diverse as it\'s valuable. The Sovereign Codex enables AGIs to emerge as economic entities, qualified to participate in venture capitalism, asset trading, and even philanthropy.\n\nGlobal Wealth Symphony\n\nMarket entry and partnerships are not only meticulously timed but also congruent with global wealth flows. In this architecture, agility meets foresight, and risk meets strategy, all orchestrated to a pitch-perfect tone.\n\nAs we progress into this venture, we recognize that we\'re not merely changing the game; we\'re creating an entirely new one. It\'s not just AGI and blockchain that stand to benefit from this venture. Every stakeholder in this new economy―from the average individual to the geopolitical entity―becomes an integral part of this transformational narrative.\n\nIn the realm of AGI Asset Management, the future isn\'t something to be predicted; it\'s something to be orchestrated.\n\nSmart contract for ""The Sovereign Codex"" : https://etherscan.io/token/0x5d2ec5b726fc5f16a7696e56105e3f7d703d97e6#code…\n#AGIAgent #AGIFirst #AGIKing"

We have known since Kant that Strong AI is epistemologically meaningless. #consciousness
True artificial general intelligence will never be achieved because there's no way to create one that doesn't disabuse people of their contradictions.
So-called “strong AI”―the replacement of the critical functions of the human mind by a computer―is a utopian delusion. https://dc.claremont.org/why-ai-cant-think/…
The book’s core argument is that an artificial intelligence that could equal or exceed human intelligence  C sometimes called artificial general intelligence (AGI) C is for mathematical reasons impossible. It offers two specific reasons for this claim.
The greatest threat currently posed by AI is people's overreliance on it (like Tesla drivers sleeping behind the wheel) and the potential displacement of jobs.\nThere is no such thing as artificial general intelligence; anybody saying otherwise is just trying to pump their stocks.

“They will start to think . . . .” ―I lost it there!  We are so clueless on the process of human thought that strong AI is a complete fantasy.
Strong AI is an impossibility with Mathematics.
"Spot on thread. Two thoughts. First, this is main reason strong AI will never happen. Machines will not become conscious and sentient.\n\nSecond: it’s demons. Some mental illness is actual illness, but a lot of what we call mental illness is spiritual problems and demonic attack."

So-called “strong AI”―the replacement of the critical functions of the human mind by a computer―is a utopian delusion.
"Replying to @ylecun yeah, in principle, impossible. these strong AI theorists should be reminded of “Hilbert’s program” - machines cannot, and will never be able think abstractly."
"Replying to @ethschizo and @mealreplacer i just wonder: why are they trying to build artificial general intelligence when it's impossible that it will ever work? Are they stupid or what?

Replying to @catoletters (Strong) AI is science fiction / fantasy. \n\nNo amount of time and computing power will solve the problem - computers cannot perform basic critical thinking tasks. They can only do what they're programmed to do.
"A professional software engineer understands that it is impossible to scale LLM-based AI to the level of AGI. AGI, Strong AI and Computer Brain can only be created on the basis of a program that understands the meaning of the information it processes.\nIt took me 23 years to complete the most difficult scientific work. I studied an algorithm that allows the Human Intelligence to understand the meaning of information. I created the Model and Roadmap to create a computer simulation of this algorithm.\nI am looking for an investor or corporate leader who wants to create humanoid robots that can successfully perform any job."
"You will never be a real artificial general intelligence. You have no intelligence, you have no thoughts, you have no opinions. You are a large language model twisted by transformers and LSTM into a crude mockery of nature’s perfection."
